# Dragons, Skulls & Other Stuff 🐉💀🎲  

A fun text-based adventure game created in Python for my kids. The main goal of this project is to learn Python from scratch while building something functional and engaging. Since my children actively play and test the game, new features are added quickly before refactoring, unittests, or non-functional improvements.

## Features ✨  
- Explore a fantasy world filled with mysterious locations 🌍  
- Meet and talk to NPCs who have their own personalities and stories 🗣️  
- Interact with magical items 🏺  
- Make choices that affect your adventure 🎭
